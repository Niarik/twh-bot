Chilly mornings and evenings are accompanied by thick fog, the weather varies from lengthy storms to brief showers. When the rain clears, it is cloudy and overcast, but the days are warm enough for most species to begin their first wave of nesting, hoping to raise their hatchlings enough to get them through the coming drought.",

Water is still accessible for large species who can break the ice, but some herds may have to periodically travel in search of roots and nuts. Carnivores are particularly dangerous during The Freeze, driven from their winter dens only by extreme hunger.",
